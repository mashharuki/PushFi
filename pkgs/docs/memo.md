## What it does

Pushfi is a full-on chain game that is revolutionizing Web3 marketing!

Users do not need to set up a password to start using the system.  
Privy and BiconomySDK provide a user-friendly UX.

All the user has to do is press a button!

When the game starts, the user has 15 seconds to press a series of buttons. The number of times you press the button increases your chances of minting a Super NFT!

If 100 people play the game at once, it is possible to fire nearly 10,000 transactions!

During the waiting time between firing transactions, users can watch advertisements to make good use of their spare time!

## The Value of this product

Privy ✖️ AA ✖️ The simple UI makes this blockchain game super easy to play!

The game also incorporates an element that has not been incorporated into blockchain systems before, which is the continuous hitting of the buttons, making it enjoyable for the user.

The steps to play the game are simple, so even those who are not familiar with blockchain can get involved and create a transaction storm!

The potential to make Web3 more interesting and exciting is the main attraction of PushFi!  
PushFi can be run on any blockchain as long as it is an EVM blockchain and Biconomy compliant!

## Technologies I used

hardhat  
TypeScript  
Account Abstraction  
openzeppelin  
yarn workspaces  
Privy  
BiconomySDK  
Web3Storage  
TheGraph

## What we learned

We learned how to develop AA applications using a combination of Privy and BiconomySDK.  
We were also able to come up with and implement a method of applying batch transactions to fire a transaction only when the user hits the button repeatedly.

We also learned how to create a product that combines three categories that are considered relatively compatible with AA: games and advertising.

## What's next for future Wave

Below is what we are trying to do with WaveHack.

- Introduce new protocols such as TheGraph.
- Consideration of support for other chains, such as MantaNetwork.
